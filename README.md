# Getting started

1. Clone this repo. This monorepo contains both frontend and backend applications.
   1. # For the ui project (under /client):
      1. Go to client directory and install necessary dependencies there. `cd ./client && npm install`
      2. Run `npm run start`
      3. Now the frontend app should be available at `http://localhost:3000`
   2. # For the api project (under /server):
      1. Go to server directory and install necessary dependencies there. `cd ./server && npm install`
      2. Run `npm run start:dev`
      3. Now the backend app should return `hello world` when you visit `http://localhost:5555`
